# We are currently testing the latest 1.1.0 Guacamole images
# (guacamole and guacd), and we are still seeing sporadic VNC
# disconnections by Guacamole (as described in
# https://github.com/cisagov/pca-gophish-composition-packer/pull/#1)
# when we do not start the VNC server with -SecurityType VncAuth (to
# disable the TLSVnc authentication).
#
# In the Guacamole PR with the potential fix for this issue, they state:
#
# Note that support for these callbacks was released in
# LibVNCServer/Client 0.9.11, so it will only work against 0.9.11 or
# later - the bug documented in GUACAMOLE-414 will still be present
# when using libvncserver/client prior to 0.9.11.
#
# We should be fine on that front, since our VNC server host is
# running with libvncserver version 0.9.12:
#
# dpkg -l | grep libvncserver
# ii  libvncserver1:amd64  0.9.12+dfsg-8  amd64  API to write one's own VNC server
#
# Note that the error message in the VNC server is slightly different now:
#
# VNCSConnST:  closing 10.224.1.13::60288: readTLS: Decryption has failed. (-24)
# ...
# TLS:         TLS session wasn't terminated gracefully
#
# Here is what it looks like in the guacd Docker container log:
#
# guacd | guacd[567]: ERROR:	Error handling message from VNC server.
# guacd | guacd[567]: INFO:	Internal VNC client disconnected
#
# I see two possibilities:
#
# * Fairly unlikely: The Guacamole fix that was made back in April
#   2019 has not made its way into the Docker image created on
#   Jan. 29, 2020.
# * More likely: There is an additional issue going on here that we
#   are not aware of.
# * For now, we will continue to run without using TLSVnc
#   authentication.
#
# Reminder to get rid of this in the future:
#   https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-vnc-server/issues/5
