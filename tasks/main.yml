# Guacamole prefers to connect to the VNC server with TLSVnc security,
# however that resulted in frequent disconnections of the VNC session
# with errors like the following (from /home/vnc/.vnc/ip-*:1.log):
#    Connections: closed: 10.10.50.20::53496
#                 (readTLS: (unknown error code) (384))
#     TLS:         TLS session wasn't terminated gracefully
# The root cause may be:
# https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-414 However, the fix
# for that issue has not yet made it's way to the official Guacamole
# docker image, which is what we use.  Until that happens, our
# workaround is to force the VNC server to not accept authentication
# via TLS ("TLSVnc"), and only accept "VncAuth".  This is accomplished
# by adding "-SecurityType VncAuth" as a startup parameter to
# vncserver in the systemd service file.
#
# Reminder to get rid of this in the future:
